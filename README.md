## About the Project

The About Me Project is a personal website created as part of a web development class. Building this website taught me the basic skills for web development while having fun attributing my own style to it.

The website includes the following sections:
- **Hero Section**
- **Biography**
- **Hobbies Section**
- **Gallery**
- **Blog**
- **Contact Form**

While building this website, I have learned and applied a range of web development skills, including:

1. **Git & GitHub**: To better understand making changes, updating, and saving, I used GitHub. I used branching, commits, merges, and pull requests to manage changes through VSCode. 

2. **HTML5**: I learned about HTML elements and their structure, creating a semantic layout for the website. I used `header`, `footer`, `nav`, `section`, and other HTML5 elements to ensure accessibility and readability.

3. **CSS3**: My favorite part about this project was adjusting the styling to my liking using CSS. I updated the color scheme and ensured each section was organize by using different properties like Flexbox and CSS Grid for the layout. I also learned how to configure the Responsive design to ensure that my website adapts well to the sizes of different screens.

4. **Interactive Elements**: I incorporated interactive features such as a contact form and hover effects, to create a smooth and user-friendly experience.

5. **Netlify**: I deployed the website using Netlify, learning how to connect a GitHub repository to a live site and check for whatever needed updates. 


## Challenges
One challenge I faced along the way was the responsive navigation bar. For some reason it took me a long time to finally get it right and I think I still have room for improvement. Another challenge was going back and forth between the index.html and the style.css file. Sometimes my files did not align so it took me a long time to figure out what I overlooked. The many mistakes I have made along the way grant me a path to success, as mistakes are the best way to learn!
